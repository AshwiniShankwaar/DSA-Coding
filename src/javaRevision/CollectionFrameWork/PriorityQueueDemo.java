/**
 * A PriorityQueue in Java is a data structure that operates on the principles of a heap. It is part
 * of the java.util package and is commonly used to process elements based on their priority.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * Order: By default, a PriorityQueue is a min-heap, meaning the smallest element is always at the front.
 * For a max-heap, you need to provide a custom comparator.
 * Dynamic Resizing: The size of the PriorityQueue adjusts dynamically as elements are added or removed.
 * Efficient Operations: Insertion and removal of the highest-priority element take
 * O(log n),while retrieval of the highest-priority element takes O(1)
