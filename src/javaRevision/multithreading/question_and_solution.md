### MultiThreading (Multiple thread)
- associate with programming languages
- inside a single program 
- thread independent(parallel processing)

## life cycle of thread

1. Born(create) by implementing runnable interface or extending thread class
Mythread threaddemo = new Mythread();//born
threaddemo.start()
2. runnable state: start will send the thread to runnable state
waiting for the thread scheduler to provide processor
3. running state: task perform
in case yield() thread running -> runnable state
4. died state

# Beginner-Level Questions
## Basics of Multithreading:

* What is javaRevision, and how is it different from multiprocessing?
* What are the benefits of using javaRevision in applications?
* Explain the lifecycle of a thread in your preferred programming language.
* How do you create and start a thread in your chosen language (e.g., Java, Python, C++)?

## Thread Safety:

* What is thread safety, and why is it important in javaRevision?

* What are the common issues faced when working with multithreaded programs (e.g., race conditions, deadlocks)?

## Synchronization:

* What is synchronization, and how do you use it to prevent race conditions?

* Practice: Write a program to increment a counter in multiple threads safely using synchronization.

# Intermediate-Level Questions
## Locks and Semaphores:

* What is the difference between a lock and a semaphore?

* Practice: Implement a producer-consumer problem using semaphores.

## Thread Communication:

* How do threads communicate with each other in a multithreaded program?
* Practice: Write a program where two threads print numbers alternately (e.g., Thread A prints odd, Thread B prints even).

## Thread Pooling:

* What is a thread pool, and why is it beneficial?

* Practice: Write a program that demonstrates a thread pool handling a queue of tasks.
## Deadlocks:

* What causes a deadlock in javaRevision, and how can it be avoided?

* Practice: Write a program that simulates a deadlock scenario and then resolves it using proper resource ordering.
## Reentrancy:

* What does it mean for a function to be reentrant, and why is this important in javaRevision?
# Advanced-Level Questions
## Atomicity and Volatile Variables:

* What are atomic operations, and how are they used in javaRevision?
* Practice: Write a program using atomic variables to implement a thread-safe counter.
* What is a volatile variable, and when should it be used?
## Concurrent Data Structures:

* Explain the use of concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap, BlockingQueue, etc.
* Practice: Implement a thread-safe queue from scratch.
## Deadlock Detection and Prevention:

* What are some algorithms to detect and prevent deadlocks in multithreaded applications?
## Performance Tuning:

* How do you identify and resolve bottlenecks in a multithreaded program?
* Practice: Write a multithreaded program and analyze its performance with varying thread counts.
## Parallel Algorithms:

* Explain how to divide tasks among multiple threads for parallel processing.
* Practice: Implement a parallel merge sort using multiple threads.
## Advanced Synchronization Tools:

* How do tools like read-write locks, condition variables, and barriers work?
* Practice: Write a program to demonstrate the use of a read-write lock.
## Asynchronous Programming and Future Objects:

* What is asynchronous programming, and how does it relate to javaRevision?
* Practice: Implement a task using Future or Promise (e.g., fetching data from multiple sources simultaneously).
